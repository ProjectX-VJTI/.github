# Project X

Project X is an **exclusive** club at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai, meant to serve as a healthy environment for students to learn from each other and grow together.

## Mentorship Programme
The heart of Project X is a mentorship programme organised for juniors, by seniors, where juniors take up a variety of challenging projects across many domains.
Through the guidance of their mentors, these students are able to complete daunting tasks in a relatively short timeframe, gaining significant exposure and knowledge in their domain of choice.
